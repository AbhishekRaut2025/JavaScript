# JavaScript Learning Playground 🧠💻

This repository is a growing collection of my JavaScript journey—including core language concepts and hands-on DOM manipulation practice.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

### `basics/`  
Contains all core JavaScript topics I've explored, such as:
- Variables, loops, and functions
- Arrays, objects, destructuring
- Promises, async/await, closures, and more

### `DOM/`  
Interactive examples using DOM APIs:
- `query-selector/` – Demonstrates `querySelector` vs. `querySelectorAll`
- *(More coming soon: event-listeners, style-changing, form-handling, etc.)*

---

## 🚀 How to Run Examples

To run a DOM example:
1. Navigate into a folder, e.g. `DOM/query-selector/`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to test the feature

---

## 🛠️ Future Goals

- Add more DOM topics
- Explore JavaScript fetch and APIs
- Improve documentation with live demos (GitHub Pages maybe?)

Happy coding! 😊
